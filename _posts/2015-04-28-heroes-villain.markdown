You could say that he saw the glass half full, recognizing the bright side of life. Humanity was striving, pursing their potential and pushing the boundaries of human understanding. There was hope, justice, and freedom, attributes that made the world a brighter, warmer place; and he was their protector. The guardian of the city, the savior, societyâ€™s sentinel, the solution to all the anguish.


In his eyes the glass was half empty, there was no light in his life, just blank consuming darkness. Humanity was suffering, incapable of reaching its potential. Nothing was true, everything was a lie. Hope, justice, and freedom were just manifestations of a race searching for comfort in a cold dark world. There was only hate, fear, and bondage; and he was their revealer. The destroyer of the city, the torturer, the murderer, the cause to all the anguish.
