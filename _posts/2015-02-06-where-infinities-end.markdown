*oblivion \|əˈblivēən\| noun*

_1 the state of being unaware or unconscious of what is happening_

For most of my existence I’ve been unaware, simply drifting through the journey of life existing in an unconscious state that has always appeared to be infinite. My life has been an oblivion, simply passing by… 

However. 

As I’m getting older this state of infinite oblivion ceases. I gain consciousness, I gain control, I grab life and for a brief moment become aware. Most of what you see through the crack will be of these moments. These moments of brief realization before I slip back into oblivion. As I age these moments are becoming longer and more frequent. 

This abysmal oblivion is becoming a floor. 

This, is where infinities end.
