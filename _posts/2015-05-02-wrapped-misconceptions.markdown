<span class="firstcharacter green">I</span> magine encompassed within your hands rests a <span class="highlight">warm, soft, smoothly wrapped burrito</span>. The temptatious smell of meat merged with cheese gingerly fondles your nostrils. Not able to resist the seducing aroma any longer, you bite into the wrap and break the floodgates of pleasure and joy upon your taste buds. As your ravishing appetite is calmed, you sit on white plastic listening to today's 'top' hits and looking at your fellow comrades as they devour their meals. So where are you? Cilantro Mexican Grill? Perhaps Chipotle? Neither, you are dining in the wonderfully affordable and dependable <span class="highlight">Taco Bell</span>.

Taco Tuesday quickly became a popular thing with myself and some college acquaintances and the preferred place of choice was Taco Bell. Specifically between 2pm and 5pm because of the 'Happier Hour' deal which made any medium drink and griller burrito only a dollar. A lovely deal that's hard to refuse. A young man wearing beats headphones around his neck caught my eye. Despite wearing the headset around his neck he was blasting Rihanna, <span class="highlight">creating a personal space sound bubble</span>. Whomever broke through the barrier was now in his world where he was in control of what was played and heard. As I watched the man walk away I gently sipped on my Baja Blast, the cold refreshing drink that completes any Taco Bell meal. Its blue icy liquid hugged every taste bud as it pursued down my mouth. The smell of my unfinished burrito called to my nose <span class="highlight">snapping my attention back to eating</span>.

The loaded potato griller was always a satisfying and well affordable meal, something that’s hard to come by for college students. Often time’s students are distracted with exams or work and forget to make or bring a well cooked meal. Thankfully there’s always a Taco Bell nearby, its unfailing dependability always able to provide a quick hunger fix. As I continued to bite into my meal my eyes began to wander again, this time focusing on <span class="highlight">a news report on the flat screen TV</span> mounted on the pillar in-between the escalators leading to the theaters. It was a report about some <span class="highlight">government conspiracy</span> bordered by moving headlines providing the current status of the stock market. It was impossible to listen to amidst the cacophony of the food court. Captions plastered the screen so that anyone interested could stop and read them. I looked down at the remaining fragment of my burrito and thought. 

<span class="highlight">"How often does our society consume prepackaged, enticingly seasoned garbage that we so freely and conveniently consume".</span>
